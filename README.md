# ML-DL_pretrained_model_resources
This repository contain information about websites and other repositories where we can get open source code, datasets and pretrained Machine Learning & Deep Learning models. The main idea is to divide the content into three main subjects: Public Datasets, Pre-trained Models and Simulator Environments
